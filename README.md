Evaluating the Performance of different ML Algorithms

This repository contains modular Python scripts for:

- Training deep learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
- Model conversion to ONNX format
- Running inference using Keras and ONNX Runtime
- Data balancing for training and testing
