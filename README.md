# 🧠 ML Model Training & Inference Scripts

This repository contains modular Python scripts for:

- Training deep learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
- Model conversion to ONNX format
- Running inference using Keras and ONNX Runtime
- Data balancing for training and testing

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `Train/` – Training scripts
- `Inference/` – Inference scripts (Keras & ONNX)
- `Data_balance/` – Data balancing for training/testing
- `results/` – Output results
- `convert_to_onnx.py` – Converts trained Keras models to ONNX
- `Evaluating the performance of different ML algorithms.ipynb` – Notebook with model comparisons
